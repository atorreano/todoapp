# ToDo App

This application is written for the purpose of an exercise. It uses various Angular elements such as Modules, Components, Routing, etc. 

Check out the source code to learn more about it.

The application contains only front-end and does not interact with any server side. 

### Note
Strictly speaking, this application is developed with Angular 7. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that it will work with the other versions of Angular. 

# How to run?

- Clone it with `git clone git@github.com:tarikguney/todoapp`
- Make sure you have Angular CLI installed. If you don't have it, then run `npm install @angular/cli` to install it.
- Install all of the dependencies by running `npm install` in the same directory this project resides on your local machine.
- Run `ng serve` in the location where `todoapp` source code resides. Angular, by default, uses `4200` port. You can change it by passing `--port [portnumber]` flag. For instance, `ng serve --port 4201`
- Visit the web site the Angular CLI started. Usually the website is `locahost:4200` unless you specified a different port number.

You can find more information about the Angular CLI here: https://angular.io/cli
