# ToDo Application

This application is written for the purpose of an exercise. It uses various Angular elements such as Modules, Components, Routing, etc. 

Check out the source code to learn more about it.

The application contains only front-end and does not interact with any server side. 

### Note
Strictly speaking, this application is developed with Angular 7. Therefore, I cannot guarantee that it will work with the other versions of Angular. 

# How to run?

1. Clone it with `git clone git@github.com:tarikguney/todoapp`
2. Make sure you have Angular CLI installed. If you don't, then run `npm install @angular/cli` to install it.
3. Run `ng serve` in the location where `todoapp` source code resides.
4. Visit the web site the Angular CLI started.

After these steps, if you cannot start the website, perhaps you should learn Angular as the first thing.
